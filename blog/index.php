				Hi, and welcome to my blog. In my initial few postings, I will be getting into the basics of web development making my way from frontend developer to backend development and covering a few different technologies, I will explain what Frontend vs. Backend is don’t worry. I will be mainly aiming to aid those trying to get into web development but get lost in all the acronyms and terminologies that clutter tutorials nowadays. There are an abundant of new frameworks, I will explain what frameworks are as well, but the underlying technologies are all the same. It’s these technologies that you should master in order to be able to take full advantaged and truly appreciate the more advanced technologies used in web development nowadays. As a new web developer or someone who just wants to educate themselves on web development, if you start off trying to use these advanced technologies, you will have many gaps in your knowledge. This is because you will not truly understand the underlying technologies that they are built on, therefore starting you off at a disadvantage.

				I will not be going into details or getting to involved initially but will give an overview of how web developer works, essentially it architecture. I truly believe that knowing the architecture of something you are trying to learn it the best starting point. Followed by learning the underlying technologies that it is built on. Only then can you start to take advantaged of these advanced technologies. I feel it is a misconception, that you must take classes to be a great developer. My opinion is that it does not take classes but just passion, determination, and motivation to read, learn, and implement.

				Please note that on all my blogs these are my opinions based off of many years of research and work/personal experience. If you do not agree with any of my options I'm sorry, but for the most part, I will be explaining how web technologies/development works, which are facts. Whether or not I approve or like a technology over another is where my opinion will come in, but that should be up to you to decide by implementing and practicing it. I am a great advocated of teaching others to code. I feel that this forces a different way of thinking and viewing the world, so now let's begin.
